# knausj_german

This is a repo related to [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) and offers a set of german commands for [knausj_talon](https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon).

## Status
- Initial creation of .py and .talon files
- No comprehensive tests yet
- Looking for the right terms
- Refactoring personal repository
- Current focus on windows scripts (I use currently no Mac or Linux os).

The repository contains two features not available in knausj as I use them personally in my german setup:
- quick.py : Load a command to be executed as a natural follow up of the current command. E.g. set quick macro to "Paste" when calling "Copy".
- TODO: Make a better example

- terms.py: Being able to replace key terms in all script at once while looking for the right terms is helpful.
- TODO: Explain how to update help.py
